# 🧠 BERT-Based Text Emotion Analyzer

This repository contains a fine-tuned BERT model used for detecting emotions and sentiment in text, trained as part of the **AI Powered Smart Cognitive Tracker** project — an AI system designed to detect early signs of mental health issues in adolescents.

## 🎯 Purpose

Text from sources such as social media posts, journal entries, or messages can carry subtle signs of emotional or cognitive distress. This model analyzes such text using **BERT** to classify emotional states like sadness, anxiety, anger, or positivity.

## 🛠️ Model Highlights

- 📖 **Model**: BERT (base-uncased or multilingual)
- 🧠 **Use Case**: Early detection of emotional distress via natural language
- 📊 **Training Data**: Custom or public emotional classification dataset
- 🧪 **Platform**: Google Colab
